This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe raw pointers and vector manipulation. The `bug.rs` file contains code that leads to undefined behavior due to unsafe modification of a vector. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version using safe Rust techniques. The error arises from directly manipulating memory using a raw pointer without proper bounds checking.
